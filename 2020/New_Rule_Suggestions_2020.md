# 2020 New Rule Suggestions

1. 2nd place gets paid less. 3rd place gets no money. Regular season winner gets the difference. (1st $450, 2nd $100, regular season winner $50)
2. League winner picks locations of the next seasons draft (reasonable distance and cost). (No)
3. League winner picks the Sacko's meal before the case race. (Yes, Max $12, must be from a resturant, and has to be within reason) 
4. Add an IR spot (3 - COVID only)
5. HASU included with league fees (of course)
